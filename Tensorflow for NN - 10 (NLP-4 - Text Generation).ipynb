thing', 'and thyme brings all things to my mind', 'nlyme with all its flavours, along with all its joys', 'thyme, brings all things to my mind', 'once i and a bunch of thyme', 'i thought it never would decay', 'then came a lusty sailor', 'who chanced to pass my way', 'and stole my bunch of thyme away', 'the sailor gave to me a rose', 'a rose that never would decay', 'he gave it to me to keep me reminded', 'of when he stole my thyme away', 'sleep, my child, and peace attend thee', 'all through the night', 'guardian angels god will send thee', 'soft the drowsy hours are creeping', 'hill and dale in slumber sleeping', 'i my loving vigil keeping', 'while the moon her watch is keeping', 'while the weary world is sleeping', 'oer thy spirit gently stealing', 'visions of delight revealing',

presence of my lover', 'hark, a solemn bell is ringing', 'clear through the night', 'thou, my love, art heavenward winging', 'home through the night', 'earthly dust from off thee shaken', 'soul immortal shalt thou awaken', 'with thy last dim journey taken', 'oh please neer forget me though waves now lie oer me', 'i was once young and pretty and my spirit ran free', 'but destiny tore me from country and loved ones', 'and from the new land i was never to see.', 'a poor emigrants daughter too frightened to know', 'i was leaving forever the land of my soul', 'amid struggle and fear my parents did pray', 'to place courage to leave oer the longing to stay.', 'they spoke of a new land far away cross the sea', 'and of peace and good fortune for my brothers and me', 'so we parted from townland with much weeping and pain', 'kissed the loved ones and the friends we would neer see again.', 'the vessel was crowded with disquieted folk', 'the escape from past hardship sustaining their hope', 'but as the last glimpse of ireland faded into the mist', 'each one fought back tears and felt strangely alone.', 'the seas roared in anger, making desperate our plight', 'and a fever came oer me that worsened next night', 'then delirium possessed me and clouded my mind', 'and i for a moment saw that land left behind.', 'i could hear in the distance my dear mothers wailing', 'and the prayers of three brothers that id see no more', 'and i felt fathers tears as he begged for forgiveness', 'for seeking a new life on the still distant shore.', 'over in killarney', 'many years ago,', 'me mither sang a song to me', 'in tones so sweet and low.', 'just a simple little ditty,', 'in her good ould irish way,', 'and ld give the world if she could sing', 'that song to me this day.',

theres plenty of oats for a soldiers horse,', 'to eat it if hes able.', 'then she took me by the lily-white hand', 'and she led me to the table', 'saying: theres plenty of wine for a soldier boy,', 'to drink it if youre able.', 'then i got up and made the bed', 'and i made it nice and aisy', 'then i got up and laid her down', 'saying: lassie, are you able?', 'and there we lay till the break of day', 'and divil a one did hear us', 'then i arose and put on me clothes', 'saying: lassie, i must leave you.', 'and when will you return again', 'and when will we get married', 'when broken shells make christmas bells', 'we might well get married', 'in 1803 we sailed out to sea', 'out from the sweet town of derry', 'for australia bound if we didnt all drown', 'and the marks of our fetters we carried.', 'in the rusty iron chains we sighed for our wains', 'as our good wives we left in sorrow.', 'as the mainsails unfurled our curses we hurled', 'on the english and thoughts of tomorrow.', 'oh oh oh oh i wish i was back home in derry.', 'i cursed them to hell as our bow fought the swell.', 'our ship danced like a moth in the firelights.', 'white horses rode high as the devil passed by',

have gone by and ive ended me bond', 'and comrades ghosts are behind me.', 'a rebel i came and iii die the same.', 'on the cold winds of night you will find me', 'on the banks of the roses, my love and i sat down', 'and i took out my violin to play my love a tune', 'in the middle of the tune, o she sighed and she said', 'o johnny, lovely johnny, would you leave me', 'o when i was a young man, i heard my father say', 'that hed rather see me dead and buried in the clay', 'sooner than be married to any runaway', 'by the lovely sweet banks of the roses', 'o then i am no runaway and soon ill let them know', 'i can take a good glass or leave it alone', 'and the man that doesnt like me, he can keep', 'his daughter home', 'and young johnny will go roving with another', 'and if ever i get married, twill be in the month of may', 'when the leaves they are green and the meadows', 'they are gay', 'and i and my true love can sit and sport and play', 'on the lovely sweet banks of the roses', 'but black is the colour of my true loves hair.', 'his face is like some rosy fair,', 'the prettiest face and the neatest hands,', 'i love the ground whereon he stands.', 'i love my love and well he knows', 'i love the ground whereon he goes', 'if you no more on earth i see,', 'i cant serve you as you have me.', 'the winters passed and the leaves are green', 'the time is passed that we have seen,', 'but still i hope the time will come', 'when you and i shall be as one.', 'i go to the clyde for to mourn and weep,', 'but satisfied i never could sleep,', 'ill write to you a few short lines', 'ill suffer death ten thousand times.', 'so fare you well, my own true love', 'the time has passed, but i wish you well.', 'when you and i will be as one.', 'i love the ground whereon he goes,', 'the prettiest face, the neatest hands', 'her eyes they shone like the diamonds', 'youd think she was queen of the land', 'and her hair hung over her shoulder', 'tied up with a black velvet band.', 'in a neat little town they call belfast', 'apprenticed to trade i was bound', 'and many an hours sweet happiness', 'i spent in that neat little town.', 'till bad misfortune came oer me', 'that caused me to stray from the land', 'far away from my friends and relations', 'to follow the black velvet band.', 'well, i was out strolling one evening', 'not meaning to go very far', 'when i met with a pretty young damsel', 'who was selling her trade in the bar.', 'when i watched, she took from a customer', 'and slipped it right into my hand', 'then the watch came and put me in prison', 'bad luck to the black velvet band.', 'next morning before judge and jury', 'for a trial i had to appear', 'and the judge, he said, you young fellows...', 'the case against you is quite clear', 'and seven long years is your sentence', 'youre going to van diemans land', 'far away from your friends and relations', 'so come all you jolly young fellows', 'id have you take warning by me', 'whenever youre out on the liquor, me lads,', 'beware of the pretty colleen.', 'shell fill you with whiskey and porter', 'until youre not able to stand', 'and the very next thing that youll know, me lads,', 'youre landed in van diemans land.', 'heres a health to you, bonnie kellswater', 'for its there youll find the pleasures of life', 'and its there youll find a fishing and farming', 'and a bonnie wee girl for your wife', 'on the hills and the glens and the valleys', 'grows the softest of women so fine', 'and the flowers are all dripping with honey', 'there lives martha, a true love of mine', 'bonnie martha, youre the first girl i courted', 'youre the one put my heart in a snare', 'and if ever i should lose you to another', 'i will leave my kellswater so fair', 'for this one and that one may court her', 'but no other can take her from me', 'for i love her as i love my kellswater', 'like the primrose is loved by the bee', 'oh bridgit omalley, you left my heart shaken', 'with a hopeless desolation, id have you to know', 'its the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken', 'and your beauty will haunt me wherever i go.', 'the white moon above the pale sands, the pale stars above the thorn tree', 'are cold beside my darling, but no purer than she', 'i gaze upon the cold moon till the stars drown in the warm sea', 'and the bright eyes of my darling are never on me.', 'my sunday it is weary, my sunday it is grey now', 'my heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone', 'all joy is dead within me, my life has gone away now', 'for another has taken my love for his own.', 'the day it is approaching when we were to be married', 'and its rather i would die than live only to grieve', 'oh meet me, my darling, eer the sun sets oer the barley', 'and ill meet you there on the road to drumslieve.', 'oh bridgit omalley, youve left my heart shaken', 'i wish i was in carrigfergus', 'only for nights in ballygrant', 'i would swim over the deepest ocean', 'for my love to find', 'but the sea is wide and i cannot cross over', 'and neither have i the wings to fly', 'i wish i could meet a handsome boatsman', 'to ferry me over, to my love and die.', 'my childhood days bring back sad reflections', 'of happy times i spent so long ago', 'my boyhood friends and my own relations', 'have all passed on now like melting snow.', 'but ill spend my days in endless roaming', 'soft is the grass, my bed is free.', 'ah, to be back now in carrigfergus', 'on that long road down to the sea.', 'but in kilkenny, it is reported', 'on marble stones there as black as ink', 'with gold and silver i would support her', 'but ill sing no more till i get a drink.', 'for im drunk today, and im seldom sober', 'a handsome rover from town to town', 'ah, but im sick now, my days are numbered', 'you may travel far far from your own native land', 'far away oer the mountains, far away oer the foam', 'but of all the fine places that ive ever been', 'sure theres none can compare with the cliffs of doneen.', 'take a view oer the mountains, fine sights youll see there', 'youll see the high rocky mountains oer the west coast of clare', 'oh the town of kilkee and kilrush can be seen', 'from the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of doneen.', 'its a nice place to be on a fine summers day', 'watching all the wild flowers that neer do decay', 'oh the hares and lofty pheasants are plain to be seen', 'making homes for their young round the cliffs of doneen.', 'fare thee well to doneen, fare thee well for a while', 'and to all the kind people im leaving behind', 'to the streams and the meadows where late i have been', 'and the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of doneen.', 'in dublins fair city, where the girls are so pretty', 'i first set my eyes on sweet molly malone', 'as she wheeled her wheel-barrow', 'through streets broad and narrow', 'crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o!', 'alive, alive-o! alive, alive-o!', 'she was a fish-monger, but sure twas no wonder', 'for so were her father and mother before', 'and they each wheeled their barrow', 'she died of a fever, and no one could save her', 'and that was the end of sweet molly malone', 'but her ghost wheels her barrow', 'the garden of eden has vanished, they say', 'but i know the lie of it still;', 'just turn to the left at the bridge of finea', 'and stop when halfway to cootehill.', 'tis there i will find it,', 'i know sure enough', 'when fortune has come to me call,', 'oh the grass it is green around ballyjamesduff', 'and the blue sky is over it all.', 'and tones that are tender and tones that are gruff', 'are whispering over the sea,', 'come back, paddy reilly to ballyjamesduff', 'come home, paddy reilly, to me.', 'my mother once told me that when i was born', 'the day that i first saw the light,', 'i looked down the street on that very first morn', 'and gave a great crow of delight.', 'now most newborn babies appear in a huff,', 'and start with a sorrowful squall,', 'but i knew i was born in ballyjamesduff', 'and thats why i smiled on them all.', 'the babys a man, now hes toil-worn and tough', 'still, whispers come over the sea,', 'the night that we danced by the light of the
